## Project Overview

- **Objective**: The primary objective of this project is to develop a sentiment prediction model capable of analyzing and classifying sentiments in text data.

## Dataset

- **Dataset**: The project uses the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains a large collection of tweets along with their corresponding sentiments.
- **Data Reduction**: Note that the original dataset was reduced to 200,000 records for scalability.

## Use Cases

This sentiment prediction model has a wide range of potential applications, including:

1. **Brand Reputation Management**: The model can monitor social media platforms to gauge public sentiment about a brand, helping companies identify and address negative sentiments before they escalate.

2. **Customer Feedback Analysis**: By analyzing customer reviews and feedback on products and services, businesses can extract valuable insights to improve their offerings and customer satisfaction.

3. **Product Launch Assessment**: Prior to a product launch, the model can evaluate public reactions to teasers or announcements, helping companies anticipate the reception of their new product.

## Architecture

- **Development Environment**: The project was developed using Jupyter Notebook in IBM Watson Studio. This choice was based on the need for collaborative, interactive, and well-documented development.

## Getting Started

- To get started with the project, clone this repository to your local machine.
- Refer to the Jupyter Notebook files for a detailed walkthrough of the project's development and execution.

## Data Processing

- Data quality assessment and preprocessing were performed using Regular Expressions (re), Pandas, and NLTK. These technologies ensured automated preprocessing while maintaining data integrity.

## Feature Engineering

- Feature engineering involved the use of GloVe, scikit-learn, and Keras to transform raw data into meaningful representations, thereby enhancing the model's performance.

## Model Selection

- The project explored various algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LSTM. Hyperparameter optimization was performed using GridSearchCV for Logistic Regression and Random Forest.

## Model Performance

- The project's models were evaluated using key performance indicators such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix. These indicators ensure a balanced evaluation of classification models.

## Demonstration

- The model's capabilities were demonstrated by predicting sentiments from example text inputs. These demonstrations mimic real-world scenarios, including brand reputation management and customer feedback analysis.

## Conclusion

- The Sentiment Prediction Model opens doors to a wide range of applications. From improving brand reputation to enhancing products and services based on customer feedback, the potential impact is substantial.
